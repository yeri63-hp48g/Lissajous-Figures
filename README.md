During my experiements with lasers, I discovered that one could create a variety of Lissajous Figures using a couple of motors placed 

I later learned that these figures could be generated using an oscilliscope, an electrical instrument for viewing electrical signals using images instead of numerically, as I was accustomed to using a voltmeter. Oscilliscopes are extremely useful for studying electrical signals, straight lines for D.C. (Direct Current), sinusoidial lines for A.C. (Alternating Current), and short bursts of square waves (Digital 1's and 0's). Sinusoidial, or sine waves were the signals needed for generating Lissajous images, one for the x-axis, and another on the y-axis, after placing the oscilliscope in X-Y mode.
