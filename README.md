Lissajous figures are usually generated on an oscilliscope, an electrical instrument for viewing electrical signals, although they can also be produced by other means, ie. lasers, pendulums, etc. Oscilliscopes are extremely useful for studying signals, displaying straight lines for D.C. (Direct Current), sinusoidial curves for A.C. (Alternating Current), and short bursts of square waves (Digital 1's and 0's). Sinusoidial, or sine waves are the signals necessary for generating Lissajous images, supplying one for the x-axis, and the other for the y-axis, after placing the oscilliscope in X-Y mode.

The basic premise is that 2 sine waves, with frequencies matching a fixed ratio, will produce a pair of Lissajous figures. Each ratio produces a different pair of figures. For example, a 1:1 frequency ratio produces a both a diagonal line and a circle. The number of degrees shifted in time between the signals determines the shape of the image as it changes between these two figures. This shift gives the illusion of a figure being rotated about an axis.

To give depth to these normally static images, this program slowly shifts the time between the two signals, making the image appear to rotate clockwise and counterclockwise, updwards and downwards, all at the same time. The direction of movement is determined entirely by the observer, and which part of the figure is being tracked by the eyes.

The application begins by displaying an initial a:b ratio, with a menu to add or delete either value. Pressing the Draw button then creates the Lissajous Figure created by this ratio, and slowly rotates it. This continues until any key is pressed, to return back to the ratio screen, where a new value can be entered. 

Here's an example from Wikimedia.org showing some of the possible Lissajous Figures you'll be able to observe within the app for a given ratio and degrees shifted between the signals.
